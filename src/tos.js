          reasonably necessary, that they can review their child’s personal
          information, direct you to delete it, and refuse to allow any further
          collection or use of the child’s information, and the procedures to
          exercise their rights); (iv) give parents “direct notice” of your
          information practices before collecting information from their
          children; and (v) obtain the parents’ “verifiable consent” before
